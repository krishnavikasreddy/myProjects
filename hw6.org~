*Hypothesis*
- H_0 : \beta_1 = 0
- H_a : \beta_1 \ne 0

*Parameters*
- \alpha = 0.01
- n = 84 [nrow(crimes)]

*F Test*
- For the given \alpha and n we require that
  - F* \le F(0.99:1,82) = [qf(0.99,1,82)] = 6.95442 => conclude H_0
  - F* > F(0.99:1,82) = [qf(0.99,1,82)] = 6.95442 => conclude H_a
- From anova Table we got F = 16.834 > 6.95442 thus conclude H_a

*Decision*
- Evidence prove that we can conclude H_a thus we there is a relation between crimes and Education data




- we know that
  - F* = $\frac{MSR}{MSE}$
    - MSR = $\frac{SSR}{df_r}$ = $\frac{SSR}{1}$ = b_1^2 \sum(X_i - $\overline{X}$)^2
    - MSE = s^2{b_1} \sum(X_i - $\overline{X}$)^2
  - F* = $\frac{b_1^2}{{s^2{b_1}}}$ = (t*)^2
 
- We need to know two points t* represents a two tailed test while as F* is a one tailed test
  -(t*(1-\alpha/2:n-1))^2 = f*(1-\alpha,1,n-2)


*Hypothesis*
- H_o : \beta_1 = 0
- H_a : \beta_1 \ne 0


- Full model(we reject Null hypothesis => H_a is true => \beta_1 \ne 0)
  - CrimeRate(Y_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * Education(X_i) + \epsilon_i
- Reduced Model (We assume that Null Hypothesis is True => \beta_1 = 0)
  - CrimeRate(Y_i) = \beta_0 + \epsilon_i

- SSE(F) = \sum\epsilon_i^2{F} = \sum(Y - \beta_0 - \beta_1 * X_i)^2 = \sum(Y - $\hat{Y}$)^2 = {aModel[2,"Sum Sq"]} = 455273165

- SSE(R) = \sum\epsilon_i^2{R} = \sum(Y_i- \beta_0)^2 = \sum(Y_i - $\bar{Y})^2 = SSTO = {sum(aModel["Sum Sq"])} = 548736108

- df_F = we have two variables that determine our Y = \beta_0 and \beta_1 so =  n-2

- df_R = we have only one variable that affect our Y = \beta_0 = n-1
